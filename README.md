# 🇮🇳 India VIX Forecasting Dashboard

## 📘 Project Overview
This project predicts **India VIX (Volatility Index)** using multiple machine learning models. VIX is crucial for assessing market fear and risk, making this tool useful for traders, analysts, and financial researchers.

The project uses:
- Real historical India VIX and NIFTY 50 data
- Advanced feature engineering (lag features, volatility, momentum)
- Five different ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear, Ridge, and Lasso)
- An interactive Streamlit dashboard for live predictions and visual comparisons

## 🖥️ Dashboard Highlights
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Model Selection** | Toggle between different ML models and see how predictions vary |
| 📉 **Real-time Prediction** | Adjust input features using sliders and instantly see VIX prediction |
| 📊 **Metric Display** | Shows RMSE, MAE, R² for each model to understand accuracy |
| 🧮 **Model Insights** | Visual comparison of all models' performance on recent data |
| 🧩 **No Uploads Needed** | All inputs are slider-based — no manual data entry |

## 🧠 Important Features Used in Prediction
| Feature Name               | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `VIX_Close_Lag1/3/5/7`    | Historical VIX close values from 1, 3, 5, and 7 days ago (captures trends) |
| `NIFTY_Returns`           | Daily return of the NIFTY 50 index (market behavior) |
| `VIX_Returns`             | Daily return of the VIX (volatility shift) |
| `VIX_MA_5`, `VIX_STD_5`   | 5-day moving average and standard deviation (trend and noise smoothing) |
| `NIFTY_Volatility`        | 5-day std of NIFTY returns (market instability) |
| `VIX_Rel_Close_Open`      | Measures sentiment change during the day in VIX |
| `VIX_NIFTY_Interaction`   | Captures interplay between market return and volatility changes |
| `VIX_Above_MA`            | Binary: Is VIX currently higher than its 5-day MA? (momentum signal) |
| `NIFTY_Positive`          | Binary: Was today's NIFTY return positive? (market sentiment) |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Permission denied when creating virtual environment**
```bash
# Try using python3 instead of python
python3 -m venv myenv
```

**Issue: pip not found or outdated**
```bash
# Install/upgrade pip
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

**Issue: Streamlit not starting**
```bash
# Check if streamlit is properly installed
streamlit --version

# Reinstall if necessary
pip uninstall streamlit
pip install streamlit
```

---

## 🔄 Updating the Project
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Update dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

# Restart the application
streamlit run main.py
```
